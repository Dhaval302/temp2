				In finance, an exchange rate (also known as a foreign-exchange rate, forex rate, or rate) between two currencies is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another. It is also regarded as the value of one countryâ€™s currency in terms of another currency. Exchange rates are determined in the foreign exchange market, which is open to a wide range of buyers and sellers where currency trading is continuous. The spot exchange rate refers to the current exchange rate. The forward exchange rate refers to an exchange rate that is quoted and traded today, but for delivery and payment on a specific future date.

				Since the exchange rate of countries like Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and South Korea were very high(in the next order of 10) in comparison to the others, the map shown above does not include their data owing to the disparity while plotting the heat map.

				The above graph shows the exchange rate of multiple countries over the years 2001-2019. We observe that around the period of global recession(2008), the foreign exchange rate of Korean Won sky-rocketed. Though all the countries were hit badly, the sudden peak for South Korea shows the tremendous effects on the country.

				Since the exchange rate of countries like Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and South Korea were very high(in the next order of 10) in comparison to the others, they have been scaled up so as to be observed properly.
